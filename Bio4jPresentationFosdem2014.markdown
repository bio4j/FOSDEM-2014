## Bio4j: bigger, faster, leaner

### Slide 1-2
**What's Bio4j** --> Sort of short abstract of the project

### Slide 3
**Bio4j is opensource!**

### Slide 5-7
**Biology & DBs today**
* Problems with technology choices (RDB and so on)
* Biology is a graph and all that blablabla

### Slide 8
**Data sources (modules)**

###  Slide 9
**Some numbers**
* 1.216.993.547 relationships
* 190.625.351 nodes

### Slide 17 
**Blueprints layer**
_Apart from the set of interfaces developed as the first layer for the domain model there's an extra layer that uses Blueprints. This way weâ€™re going one step further for making the domain model independent from the choice of database technology._
