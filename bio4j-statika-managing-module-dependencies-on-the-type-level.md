# Bio4j + Statika: Managing module dependencies on the type level

<!-- Abstract from the FOSDEM site:
Bio4j bioinformatics graph database is modular and customizable, allowing you to import just the data you are interested in. There exist, though, dependencies among these resources that must be taken into account and that's where Statika enters the picture; a set of Scala libraries which allows you to declare dependencies between components of any modular system and track their correctness using Scala type system. Thanks to this, it's possible now to deploy only selected components of the integrated data sets, with Amazon Web Services deployments on hardware specifically configured for them.
-->

<!-- General (toplevel) structure:
* Bio4j modules   = customizability (important and useful)
* Statika         = a generic module system (generic and static)
* Bio4j + Statika = happiness/awesomeness/allgoodthingsintheworldtogether (for developers and users)
-->

## Bio4j modules

### Bio4j modules

<!-- some diagram of dependencies (pic) -->

----

### Bio4j releases

- a lot of data in modules => importance of possibility to import only what you need
- different releases/distributions/builds
- may be some examples of interesting/useful/non-obvious combinations (ask @pablopareja)
- (?) importance of doing it in the cloud
- real need of systemized/organized way of managing these modules

<!-- may be should be split on two slides:
* releases as combinations of modules + example(s)
* why do we need to do smth with all this (i.e. why statika is needed at all),
  at the same time without any negative on the current state 
  (like "everything is cool, but we want to make it awesome (for you, dear user)")
-->

## What is Statika

----

### Statika as a universal module system

Scala type system: [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) + [statika](https://github.com/ohnosequences/statika)

- Modules represented as Scala types
- Called "Bundles" and can depend on each other
- Type-checker validates correctness
- Statika does linearization of the deps graph

<!-- keywords: 
* mention install method and installing with deps in the right order
* acyclic directed graph
* shapeless, heterogeneous lists and etc.
* type-level traversing and linearization 
* ? 
-->

----

### Statika as a package manager

[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (Simple Build Tool) + [sbt-statika plugin](https://github.com/ohnosequences/sbt-statika)

- Bundles packed and released as versioned artifacts (jars)
- SBT tracks dependencies on the artifact level
- Statika provides an SBT-plugin for a standardized release process

<!-- may be it shouldn't be too detailed, a bit offtopic -->

----

### Statika as a deployment tool

[AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) (Amazon Web Services) + [aws-statika lib](https://github.com/ohnosequences/aws-statika)

- To "apply" a bundle — to deploy it to an EC2 instance
- Statika distributions — an abstraction for the cloud infrastructure specifics
- Statika as a configuration system

<!-- needs to be structured better -->

----

## Bio4j + Statika

<!-- the main part, so the previous introductory parts shouldn't be too long -->

----

<!-- TODO: structure this on several slides -->

- declaring layout of existing modules using statika bundles (pic of the hierarchy)
- respecting dependencies on different levels (raw data inter-deps, modules depend on raw data + their own interdeps)
- (?) possibility to make incremental import of modules to existing releases
- ease and robustness of releasing (incl. tests) and deployment (thnx to aws-statika part + statika-cli for applying bundles)
